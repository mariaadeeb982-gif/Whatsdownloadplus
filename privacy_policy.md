## **Privacy Policy – WhatsDownload Plus**

**Last updated:** November 2025

WhatsDownload Plus respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles user data.

### **1. Information We Collect**

We **do not collect, store, or share any personal data** such as contacts, messages, or media from your device.
The app only accesses files already stored on your phone (e.g., WhatsApp Statuses) to show or download them **locally** within your device.

### **2. How the App Works**

* The app scans your WhatsApp Status folder to display available photos and videos.
* You can save or delete statuses locally; they remain on your phone unless you manually remove them.
* The app does **not upload or transfer** your media to any server.

### **3. Permissions**

To function properly, the app requests the following permissions:

* **Storage permission:** Required to access and save media files from your WhatsApp Statuses.
* **Notification permission (optional):** Used only to detect new WhatsApp status updates if you enable the feature.

These permissions are used **solely for app functionality**, not for tracking or analytics.

### **4. Third-Party Services**

WhatsDownload Plus does **not integrate third-party analytics or advertising SDKs** that track user behavior.
If future updates add such services, users will be informed and given a choice to opt out.

### **5. Security**

All actions occur locally on your device.
We do not have access to your WhatsApp account or any of your personal files.

### **6. Children’s Privacy**

Our app is **not directed toward children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect any information from minors.

### **7. Updates to This Policy**

We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on our GitHub page or in-app “Privacy Policy” section.
